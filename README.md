# WRF_Model_Simulations
This repository includes the output (plots and scripts used to visualize output) of WRF simulations carried out in the atmospheric 
CO2 modeling work that I carried out in my postdoctoral work at UC Berkeley.

•	Carried out research focused on mesoscale and regional (forward or“bottom-up”) atmospheric 
transport modeling and analysis of anthropogenic and biogenic carbon dioxide emissions from northern California for multi-scale 
estimation and quantification of atmospheric CO2 concentrations.

•	Made extensive use of WRF (written mostly in FORTRAN), the WRF-Chem coupled weather-air quality model for atmospheric transport 
simulations, and the Vegetation Photosynthesis and Respiration Model (WRF-VPRM) biospheric model to simulate CO2 biosphere fluxes 
and atmospheric CO2 concentrations. This work also involved the use of the R statistical scripting language, 
the NCAR Command Language (NCL), MATLAB, Python, Google Earth (KML and KMZ) and Ferret for additional pre- and 
post-processing, modification, and visualization of netCDF files, and further enabling and expediting data analysis of simulation results.

•	Troubleshooted WRF, WRF-Chem, and VPRM simulation runs and results to increase data efficiency and to decrease time to solve problems.

•	Installed, compiled, built, and configured WRF, WRF-Chem, and VPRM on the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center 
(NERSC) multi-core supercomputing system “Hopper” and submitted batch job scripts to this system to run the WRF model simulations.

•	Assisted students and post-docs in installing and configuring WRF and WRF-Chem.

Research focused on mesoscale and regional (forward or “bottom-up”) atmospheric transport modeling and analysis of anthropogenic and biogenic carbon dioxide emissions from northern California for multi-scale estimation and quantification of atmospheric CO2 concentrations. This work has included extensive use of the Weather Research & Forecasting Model (written mostly in FORTRAN), the WRF-Chem coupled weather-air quality model for atmospheric transport simulations, and the Vegetation Photosynthesis and Respiration Model (WRF-VPRM) biospheric model to simulate CO2 biosphere fluxes and atmospheric CO2 concentrations. One area of focus of this work was to study and gain a better understanding of what effect diurnal varying/cycled CO2 fluxes had on simulated CO2 concentrations as compared to time-invariant CO2 flux emissions and as a way to assess source and/or sink sampling bias..]

 I also installed, compiled, built, and configured WRF, WRF-Chem, and VPRM on the NERSC multi-core supercomputing system “Hopper” and submitted batch job scripts to this system to run the WRF model simulations. In addition to the use of WRF, this work also involved the use of the R statistical scripting language, the NCAR Command Language (NCL), Matlab, Python, and Ferret (http://ferret.pmel.noaa.gov/Ferret/home) for additional pre- and post-processing, modification, and visualization of netCDF files.
